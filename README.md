Here i have used flask blueprint to simplify functioning of Personalized notebook.. It has used flask One-to-many mapping approach to show relation between user table & to Note table..
we can go through flow as it starting from main app, then it having two models i.e. auth & md . and after that i have segregated model into sub parts through different files..
